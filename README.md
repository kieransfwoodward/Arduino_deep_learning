This project explores the deployment of multiple deep learning models on a single Arduino microcontroller.

As stress continues to be a major health concern, there is growing interest in developing effective stress management systems that can detect and mitigate stress. Deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown their effectiveness in accurately classifying stress, but most of the existing solutions rely on the cloud or large, obtrusive devices for inference. The emergence of tiny machine learning provides an opportunity to bridge this gap and enable ubiquitous intelligent systems. In this article, we propose a context-aware stress detection approach that uses a microcontroller to continuously infer physical activity to mitigate motion artifacts when inferring stress from heart rate and electrodermal activity. We deploy two DNNs onto a single resource-constrained microcontroller for real-world stress recognition, with the resultant stress and activity recognition models achieving 88% and 98% accuracy, respectively. Our proposed context-aware approach improves the accuracy and privacy of stress detection systems while eliminating the need to store or transmit sensitive health data.
